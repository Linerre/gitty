# Gitty
Often the case that Git's commands, even those the most common ones such as `git fetch` and `git pull`, confuse me from time to time.

Thus, I decided to create a repository for **testing out what exactly a single one command does in Git**. 

The best way to truly understand Git is to actively get invovled in trying out every single command (with its options of course) listed in Git's [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs).
