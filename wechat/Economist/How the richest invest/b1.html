    <p class="te-p">Now an essential part of every self-respecting billionaire’s stable, <small>fos</small> are booming. Their roles include managing families’ wealth, administering their assets and often other services, from the <ruby>mundane<rt>very ordinary</rt></ruby> (paying bills) to the <ruby>knotty<rt>complicated</rt></ruby> (succession-planning). <ruby>The biggest<rt>the biggest FOS</rt></ruby> have become deal powerhouses, capable of competing with global banks and private-equity firms on big transactions. But they are also, by definition, private—and therefore little understood. “We’re the most important part of the investment landscape most people have never heard of,” says one executive.</p>

    <p class="te-p">The <small>fo</small> has its roots in the organisations that oversaw the fortunes of America’s 19th-century <ruby>robber baron<rt>强盗贵族</rt></ruby>s, such as J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller. Several hundred have been in operation for at least three generations. Some now serve extended families with hundreds of members—over 600 in the case of France’s Mulliez <ruby>clan<rt>家族</rt></ruby>, owners of the Auchan hypermarket chain. Most, however, are recent creations. Of the 311 family offices that took part in the survey for the latest annual Global Family Office Report by ubs and Campden Wealth, published in September, more than two-thirds were established after 2000 (see chart 1) and over half are serving the first generation of wealth.</p>
