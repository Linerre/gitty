      Not everyone thinks their growing influence is benign, however. Brooke Harrington of Copenhagen Business School worries that the growth of fos is undermining meritocracy in capitalism. “The bigger the apparatus they have behind them, the harder it is for the market to discipline them,” she says. Chuck Collins of the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, in Washington, dc, frets over opacity—“they ensure ever more wealth goes off the ledger”—and their growing lobbying clout. He argues that billionaires and their fos have worked tirelessly to exploit loopholes and rig rules to further their interests, most notably by helping to gut America’s estate tax. “They are in the dynasty-protection business, trying to arrest the normal, natural process of wealth dispersal,” he says.

      fos are nonetheless in expansion mode, opening satellite offices on other continents. The most popular location for new outposts is Singapore, whose government has greatly relaxed red tape in order to attract more fos. The rush to Asia is partly about locating closer to investment opportunities and partly, for mfos, about proximity to a fast-growing pool of potential new clients.

     China alone produced two new billionaires a week in 2017. Rich Asians had preferred to keep their money in the businesses they created, reinvesting to build conglomerates. The new generation, having made much of its money in technology and services, is more comfortable cashing out, trading assets and transferring a slab of their wealth to an investment office. In the past ten years the number of Asia-based fos has climbed from around 50 to somewhere between 500 and 1,000.

     This increased willingness to release cash from the primary family business and invest it elsewhere, combined with the rise of the do-it-yourself approach to managing wealth, suggests that the number of fos will go on rising. With upwards of $2trn expected to pass from entrepreneurs to their heirs over the next 15 years, the family office is entering a Gilded Age.

      <p>
	A boutique investment bank is a investment bank that specializes in at least one aspect of investment banking, generally corporate finance, although some banks are retail in nature, such as Charles Schwab or Allen & Co. Of those involved in corporate finance, <u>capital raising, mergers and acquisitions and restructuring and reorganizations are their primary activities</u>.

      Another way to bind the generations together is to accommodate younger family members’ priorities.
