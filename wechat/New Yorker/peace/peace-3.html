	<span class="cap">T</span>he people<sup style="color: #B48EAD;">❶</sup> who were farthest away seemed the most likely to perceive a threat. Students were thrilled, whereas our Chinese colleagues were curious but guarded. College administrators were warier, but even they were proud to have foreigners on campus. Opponents of the program tended to be at the Chinese provincial or national level.

        Who are those "<b>people</b>"? 學生（最近）興奮，老師（比學生遠）很好奇，學校行政層（比老師遠）謹慎但自豪。但這三種人都算不上最遠。反而是那些廟堂之遠的關老爺們最擔心、最警惕。 The people 就是指他們。這種寫法很妙。

	The American reaction was the opposite. Recently, I talked with William Speidel, a <ruby>

	</ruby> who served as the first Peace Corps China director, and he remembered the attitude of State Department officials. “They were overjoyed,” he said. “The idea that Peace Corps had a foothold in quote-unquote<sup>㋡</sup> Communist China was really something.”

But there were others whose life paths were radically transformed. They became diplomats, civil servants, businesspeople, or scholars specializing in China. Today, twenty-seven former China volunteers, including Adam, work in the State Department, and there are others at organizations like U.S.A.I.D.

	Journalists and writers were also common. Michael Meyer, a China 2 volunteer from Minnesota, went on to write three books about the country. In my cohort, three of us became China correspondents and authors. <ruby>

	I sometimes wondered how the situation looked to Communist intelligence analysts. In 1999, I moved to Beijing while preparing to publish my first book, about my experience in Fuling, and there was a period when I sensed that I was being watched with particular attention. There were strange encounters in my neighborhood, and a couple of former students back in the Fuling region reported being intimidated by security agents who showed up because of their connection with me. In Beijing, at a couple of government-sponsored events, Foreign Ministry officials sought me out with pointed questions: Why did you study English literature if you planned to go to China? Why did you teach in such an undeveloped place?

	They clearly worried that teaching had been a cover for intelligence work, and they seemed <ruby>
		baffled<rt>confused</rt>
	</ruby> by the Peace Corps. The <ruby>
		organization<rt>Peace Corps</rt>
	</ruby> didn’t attract many people from élite backgrounds, and it paid volunteers about a hundred and twenty dollars a month. Speidel’s Chinese staff had been assigned to him by the government, so there was no question that some lines of information ran straight to security, along with the likely phone taps. But nobody from Peace Corps headquarters ever told me what I should or should not teach, and staff visited Fuling only twice in two years. At its best, the Peace Corps was an expression of American confidence: if you sent motivated young people to remote places and left them alone, good things were likely to happen.<sup>㋡</sup>

	Recently, I reminisced about the era with somebody from Fuling who is well connected in the Communist Party. He confided that the Fuling volunteers were supposed to be sent to Wanxian, another Yangtze city, whose name was eventually changed to Wanzhou. But officials were concerned that the city was too close to the construction site of the Three Gorges Dam, where Americans might learn sensitive information. So they pushed us a hundred and thirty miles upstream. Of course, I ended up writing about the dam anyway. And, after the Peace Corps finally got into Wanzhou, the organization posted a China 7 volunteer named Jake Hooker there. Despite having no Chinese background, Hooker learned the language to a remarkable level, and he proved that it didn’t matter who got sent downriver. In 2008, as a reporter for the <i>Times</i>, Hooker won a Pulitzer Prize for exposing how rural Chinese factories were exporting toxic ingredients for use in pharmaceutical products.<sup>㋡</sup>

        請毒力撕烤：政府自然不樂意看到外國記者報導本國的社會負面事實。那麼那些工人願意嗎？還是說他們覺得自己只要能掙到錢就好，管它有毒沒毒呢？如果是這樣想的話，又有哪些現實因素導致了他們有這種想法呢？你會有這樣的想法嗎？
