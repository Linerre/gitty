        <span class="cap">I</span>n January, I visited Fuling with my family, and one afternoon we went to the former campus. It had been abandoned after the expanded college opened, up<sup>㋡</sup> the Yangtze. Last year, developers started tearing down the old campus in order to construct high-rise apartments.

    The classroom building was already gone, but my former apartment still stood. The library was also intact, although its doors were chained shut and many windows were broken. In front of the ruined building, a faded red banner proclaimed another tone-deaf slogan:

        While we were there, a man called out my Chinese name. He introduced himself as a former colleague who was also visiting the campus before it was demolished. Suddenly, I recognized him—in the old days, he sometimes came to my apartment late at night to borrow banned books. In front of the shuttered library, he said, “I remember reading about the Cultural Revolution.” I asked if the authorities had warned him about associating with the Americans, and he smiled shyly. “It wasn’t that direct,” he said. “But we were careful.”
    </p>


<p>
    <u><span class="u-mark">☈</span>I hadn’t known him or his colleagues as well as I knew our students.</u> In my first book, I mentioned the surreptitious visits from the man and a few others. I described them as “shadowy figures who seemed to be groping for something that couldn’t be found in Fuling.”

        I knew him or his colleagues less well than I knew my students. (If I knew everything about my students, then I just knew a few things about him.)

    Twenty years later, much remained in the shadows. I didn’t know what the teacher had gained from the banned books, or how my students were changed by our classes. But, as time passed, I was impressed by how much people remembered. “We were all poor at that time, we were eager to learn,” a student named Andi wrote recently, mentioning some school supplies that Adam had loaned her class. The accumulation of these small moments added up to something larger, but it wasn’t a formal accounting. That was a teacher’s confidence<sup>㋡</sup>—confidence<sup>㋡</sup> in his material, but also confidence<sup>㋡</sup> in his students. They could make their own decisions about how they applied their lessons.

    <span class="cap">O</span>ne evening, I spoke by telephone with Gabriel Exposito, a twenty-two-year-old who was among the last people to receive invitations to Peace Corps China. Exposito grew up in <ruby>
        Havana<rt>古巴首都：哈瓦那</rt>
    </ruby>, where one of his school memories involved a visit by a group of Americans. The children were instructed to avoid the foreigners, who made a donation that was <ruby>
        spirited away<rt>took away secretly</rt>
    </ruby> by Communist officials. Exposito’s father eventually fled to Florida, where he found work as a nurse. He brought his son over from Cuba at the age of eleven. Exposito graduated cum laude<sup>㋡</sup> from Florida State University, and when he applied to the Peace Corps he requested China.

        古巴在冷戰時也是共產主義國家。這裏寫這位志願者小時偶在學校被教育要遠離外國人。外國人給學校捐了一筆款，但是卻被學校的黨員幹部私吞了。所以下文中志願者才説自己很瞭解共產主義教育。

    “I know what a Communist education is like,” Exposito told me. “I was the student who wasn’t allowed to ask the hard questions. I saw the foreigners and couldn’t interact with them. I wanted to be on the other side of that.”
</p>

<p>
    He was shocked to learn by tweet of<sup>㋡</sup> the China program’s closure, and as a Floridian he called the offices of Senators Rubio and Scott to complain. He told staffers, “I agree with you—the Communist Party is a hostile entity. But we are breaking down the image they build of the American people.”

        這一段特別無奈心酸。兩國交惡，罪在平民？不管是交惡還是交好，得利的都是政客。

    He requested a reassignment to a former Communist state, and the Peace Corps offered Mongolia, the <ruby>
        Kyrgyz Republic<rt>
            吉尔吉斯斯坦</rt>
    </ruby>, and Moldova. Exposito chose <ruby>
        Moldova<rt>摩尔多瓦共和国</rt>
    </ruby>. “I thought, This is a former Soviet republic that’s next to Ukraine,” he said. “It’s an area that’s often forgotten about.” He had started studying Russian, and he hoped to eventually become either a scholar or a diplomat; I wished him the best of luck. He would have been perfect<sup>㋡</sup> for China 26. ♦
