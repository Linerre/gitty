      At the entrance to my compound, the Communist Party’s neighborhood committee erected a series of information boards. They displayed the new epidemic measures, along with an organizational chart for an entity called the Communist Party Service Team for Home Quarantine. Head shots and cell-phone numbers of seven officials were included. I had never lived anywhere in China where such information was posted in public.
    </p>

    <p>
      One afternoon, I dialled the number at the top of the chart. The quarantine-team leader picked up immediately, and, after I introduced myself, she promised to arrange an interview; within an hour, I received a call from the neighborhood committee’s Party secretary. He told me to stop by his office the following morning, which was a Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our conversation was masked on both sides. He was middle-aged, a serious man in a blue blazer with a safety-pinned armband that said “Party Member Service Team.” He had grown up in the neighborhood, where his father had also worked for the government. The old man had come out of retirement to don a hazmat suit during the epidemic—he was one of the volunteers who checked temperatures in front of apartment buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office contained a narrow vinyl-covered couch, and the Party secretary told me that he had slept there for the first two weeks of the quarantine, when he was working from 8 a.m. to midnight every day. His home was in a distant northern suburb, and he couldn’t afford the time to commute. In Chengdu, there are 1,685 neighborhood committees, and each had prepared a quarantine team like the one near my home. Most details of our local lockdown—the information boards, the hazmat thermometer workers—had been managed by the team, which consisted of thirty-eight people, mostly volunteers. In a jurisdiction of nearly six thousand residents, there had been exactly one case of coronavirus: the person in my compound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Party secretary explained that the resident had travelled to his home town, in Hubei, during the Lunar New Year holiday. In the early days of the epidemic, the government tracked such links so intensively that locals became terrified by the sight of a car with Hubei plates. Many Chengdu hotels turned away guests from Wuhan, so the government finally designated twelve lodgings to accept them. A friend of mine in another part of the city passed along a WeChat conversation that had occurred among people in her compound:
    </p>
    <p class="quotes">
      Resident 1: Yesterday somebody said there was a car with Hubei plates at the underground car park of Building 2.
      Property Management: O.K., I will send somebody immediately to check it out.
      Resident 2: What the fuck? This is not funny!
      Resident 1: Please have the door guard pay attention . . .
      Resident 2: I think that now we should show our I.D. card to go in and out!!!
      Resident 3: Quickly, call 110 [police] or 120 [emergency ambulance].
    </p>
    <p>
      In my neighborhood, the Party team organized periodic door-to-door surveys, which was how they learned of the resident’s Hubei trip. Thus far, people had come to my apartment three times, and they always asked about Hubei and Wuhan. Their policy was to call the community’s Health Service Center if anybody had visited those places.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They came and checked his temperature—it was 37.1,” the Party secretary told me, using the Celsius figure. (The temperature was normal.) “He didn’t feel sick, but the health officials tested him for the coronavirus, and it was positive.” Later, the man showed mild symptoms, which meant that the team had caught him at a critical time: he’d appeared normal but may have been contagious. He spent ten days under observation in the hospital, and then he was quarantined at home for fourteen days.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked the Party secretary when we would be allowed to enter our compound without the passes, and he said, “I think it will be two fourteen-day periods.” He seemed to think in this unit of time, which is the standard span of a stringent quarantine. He estimated that my daughters’ school wouldn’t resume until mid- or late April—three more fourteen-day units. When I asked if there had been much resistance to the new policies, he shook his head. “Ninety per cent of the population agrees,” he said. “We have some people who think it’s not convenient, and they want to go out and play mah-jongg or something. But most people follow the rules.”
    </p>

      From what I had seen, he wasn’t exaggerating. The overwhelming compliance was one of the most impressive features of the lockdown, along with the dedication of grassroots officials. In Wuhan, the government had sent eighteen hundred teams of epidemiologists, each consisting of at least five people, to trace the contacts of infected citizens. The W.H.O. report noted that the containment effort had been possible because of “the deep commitment of the Chinese people to collective action.” At the individual level, though, people occasionally expressed reservations. During one of my exchanges with Zhang, the pharmacist in Wuhan, I mentioned that most people I knew were supportive. He wrote back:
    </p>
    <p class="quotes">
      Everyone grumbles a lot, but everyone obeys the rules strictly. It’s very contradictory, but it’s China. Our cultural traditions dictate our thinking. We will use the word “victory” to describe the final end of the epidemic, although I personally don’t like that description.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was common for Chinese leaders to speak in such terms—President Xi Jinping had declared that the country would “defeat the virus.” Eventually, President Trump’s Twitter feed would adopt a similar tone. (“we will win!”) I asked Zhang to explain what he meant.
    </p>
    <p class="quotes">
      There is a bad tendency in China right now for the state propaganda department to turn what should be remembered as a sad incident into a comforting one. They are accustomed to using the word “victory” toward everything, the so-called man can conquer nature. I don’t think there is joy in such an incident. So many people died, and their families won’t think this is a victory whatsoever.
