        <span class="cap">T</span>wo weeks ago, a refrigerated trailer was delivered to Sherman’s. It took a few more days to install fully, first because of a holiday weekend and then because of heavy rain. “You can’t have a guy in the rain walking into a thirty-two-degree box twenty-five times,” Kasler told me. The unit was now connected to a power source and fitted with a wooden <ruby>
            ramp<rt>sloping surface</rt>
        </ruby> and interior shelves. But Sherman’s was <ruby>
            down to<rt>left with</rt>
        </ruby> its last five cremation containers. The protective pouches that Kasler and the others had used to store the victims of covid-19 were gone. They were now wrapping each body in a sheet. One morning, an assistant who was lifting a covid-19 victim from a stretcher yelped in pain. A butterfly needle<sup>❉</sup> from a hospital I.V.<sup>❉</sup>, which was still in the dead man’s arm, had pierced the sheet and pricked the assistant. “It’s a pure miracle we haven’t caught it,” Kasler said.

        By the time the refrigeration unit was up and running, last Tuesday afternoon, they were already in need of a second one. Sherman’s was finally starting to turn families away. Nineteen bodies were <ruby>
            due<rt>planned</rt>
        </ruby> to<sup>㋡</sup> go out that day, for burial or cremation, which would free up space. But on Wednesday, when many cemeteries were closed for Passover, no burials were scheduled, and more than a dozen bodies had come in. That evening, Kasler and Zambito inspected the chapel and storage rooms, cross-checking the schedule for burials that week. Eighteen bodies were supposed to go out the next day, but, due to<sup>㋡</sup> a backup at the medical examiner’s office, four of them had not yet arrived.

            醫生那邊臨時抽調人員去支援了，所以還有4具遺體沒有送過來。

        On April 16th, Governor Cuomo announced that hospitalizations in New York had stabilized and slightly fewer people were being admitted to the city’s intensive-care units each day. Kasler hadn’t noticed much of a difference. If anything<sup>㋡</sup>, he told me, the previous day was the worst one yet. “We seem to be hitting our peak,” he said. Kasler was hoping the situation would stabilize at some point in May, but it was impossible to tell whether an end was in sight. While he reviewed the week’s body count, Cottone and his son, who had come in to help, were sanitizing stretchers in the parking lot. Around ten bodies were coming in that day, Kasler said. “It won’t be long before the place is unbreathable again.”

if anything 前面通常會跟一個全盤否定的句子，其意為“如果有的話”。例如：
        </p>
        <p>
            He never sends me any gift. If anything, it's a toatl crap somebody else has given him.
        </p>
        <p>
            他可從來沒給我送過任何禮物。如果/就算有的話，那也衹是別人送他但他又不想要的破玩意！

            讀罷全文，就像看了一部春秋筆法的紀錄片，導演/作者冷靜旁觀，忠實記錄。細節描寫遍佈全文，作者就是讀者的眼。
